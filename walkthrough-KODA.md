# 🧪 Student Pentest Walkthrough Template

## 📥 Getting Started

This template is where you’ll track everything you did during your privilege escalation lab.

It mirrors how real penetration testers write reports, track steps, document evidence, and prove exploitation. Your job is to **fork this repo, clone it to your machine, edit this file, then push your work back to your GitHub account**.

## 🧭 Initial Access

### 🔹 Foothold Method

- What vulnerability did you use to gain access?
   Unrestricted file upload vulnerability

- What was the payload?
   Shell.php - 34926 bytes
   The payload creates an outbound connection, which is trusted, from within the server itself as the file I uploaded is an executable .php file which I am able to execute by navigating to the directory on the server, this triggers the shell as long as I have a listner ready to catch that connection

- Where did you upload it?
   ../../hackable/uploads/shell.php

- What URL did you visit to trigger the reverse shell?
   http://192.168.0.73/dvwa/hackable/uploads/shell.php

### 🔹 Listener Details

- What listener did you set up (command)? - 
- What session did you receive back? - 
- Paste a sample output (e.g. `meterpreter >`)

---

## 🔍 Enumeration with linPEAS

### 🔹 Kernel Version

```
uname -a output:
```

### 🔹 Notable Findings from linPEAS:

- SUID Binaries:
- Writable Cron Jobs or Scripts:
- Credentials in Files:
- Writable PATH folders:
- Anything linPEAS marked as high-risk:

**Use this to decide on your next step.**

---

## 🚩 Exploitation Path

### 🔹 Chosen Privilege Escalation Vector

- What method did you choose to escalate?
- Why was it possible to exploit?
- What did linPEAS say that helped you decide?

### 🔹 Step-by-Step Exploit Commands

```
[Insert exact commands and what each one does]
```

### 🔹 Post-Exploitation Confirmation

```
whoami
id
```

- What did you see? Prove root access with output.

---

## 💾 Optional: Bonus or Mystery Task Attempt

### 🔹 Task Attempted:

- DirtyCow / GTFOBins / Cron / PATH Hijack / Other

### 🔹 Method Used:

- Describe what you found and how you exploited it:

```
Commands and what they did:
```

### 🔹 Did it work?

- What happened?
- Did it give you root or unexpected results?

## 🧠 Reflection

- What did you learn about Linux privilege escalation?
- What would you do differently in a real-world pentest?
- What part confused you or surprised you most?

---

## ✅ Final Submission Instructions

Once your walkthrough is completed:

1. Make sure you’ve pushed the final version of `walkthrough-YOURNAME.md` to your GitHub repo

2. **Submit the link** to your GitHub repo OR create a Pull Request to the instructor repo if requested

3. Ask yourself:

   - Did I clearly explain my exploit chain?
   - Is my proof of root access shown?
   - Could another student or pentester follow my steps?

> This file is your **report**, your **evidence**, and your **portfolio piece**. Treat it like a job submission.
